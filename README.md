## Entity Framework Benchmark Console Application

This application can be used to benchmark Entity Framework in .NET Core 2.0. This is useful for comparing EF against other ORM solutions.

# Getting Started

You will need a database for the benchmark. The EF generated classes are using the Adventure Works 2017 database. The .bak download can
be found here: https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/adventureworks. Using a local database will give the most
accurate benchmark results.
